Able to enter collections of variables that are considered together and look for rules that only use those. Should be faster and might be more accurate if reliability measures support it.

Able to enter collections of variables and find rules based on aggregated measures from those variables.

Probit link is used when assumption of a latent variable (normally distributed)

What are the limitations of the method, e.g. continuous/numeric can't be used.
